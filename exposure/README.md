EXPOSURE PART:
The exposure analysis follows the pipeline proposed by Argentieri et al. (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03483-9).
For the Cardiac Motion study we considered 25 environmental factors previously associated with hearth disease.
The analysis was performed on the UK Biobank - RAP. The previous files contains:
- 0_ extract environmental factors using Jupyter Spark
- 1_ preprocessing
- 2_ imputation and post-imputation recode
- 3_ multivariable regression to identify association between environmental factors and latent motion features, and to create corresponding figures.
